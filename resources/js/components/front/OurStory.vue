       <h1>Our Story</h1>
       <h2>One’s action can inspire others to dream bigger </h2>
       <p>The journey of GB International dates back to 1983 when Mr. Jasbir Singh Rikhi founded the company single-handedly with the desire of guiding students for a better future.  He seeks to use travel as a tool to guide young minds learn from experiences outside their comfort zone. GBI has been working hard to transform this very idea into reality through finely curated travel tours.   </p><br>
        <h2>Success does not lie in results but in efforts </h2>
        <p>At GBI, we believe that to travel is to learn. It’s a belief that has shaped our path for the last 35 years and something that drive us to keep “moving ahead with time”. We foster a worldwide perspective and are attuned socially and culturally to the ever changing landscape of the classroom and the competitive global market. Keeping this in mind, we offer a number of tour programs covering a wide array of topics. Since its inception, GBI has sent more than one lakh students to different destinations across the globe.</p>
