      <sub-heading text="One’s action can inspire others to dream bigger"/>
      <paragraph text="In ancient times, the offset of travel was only on the sole purpose of spiritual fulfillment and medicinal offerings. During the course of time, people began to explore different destinations for knowledge, cultural exploration, scenic beauty and other special interests. But much of our great historical monuments and culture are still unseen and unheard to many people."/>

      <paragraph text="So, with constant efforts of our CEO Mr. Jasbir Singh Rikhi to bring back our lost cultural and    architectural heritage of our country, he aims to bridge this gap and build a strong foundation in educating young minds and passionate travellers towards our rich history. He, being a passionate traveler himself from the hospitality sector, whenever used to hit the road on his Royal Enfield to explore new places, he realised that people who came to pay a visit to that particular destination would click a photo and move on without showing any interest in its rich history, culture and not even admiring the architectural and technological advancements. This made a huge impact on him and made him realise that there is a greater need to educate people(young minds and passionate travelers) about our rich cultural heritage through fun and innovative methods."/>

      <paragraph text="And so the journey of GBI was set forth in 1983 by our CEO Mr. Jasbir Singh Rikhi single-handedly with the motive to release the pressure of classroom learning and allow young minds to learn from new and engaging environments outside their comfort zone through experiential journeys.Serving for around 40 yrs in the industry, we provide a platform for young minds and passionate travelers to explore and discover different cultural aspects and scientific explorations across the globe with journeys booked through our web platforms."/>

      <paragraph text="Our USP as an organization is to help young minds and travelers to learn, explore and discover with best-in-class service and quality, while they hit the road with us. GBI’s travel program features observation, experiential learning and skill development along with fun loaded activities."/>
      <paragraph text="Designed with academic standards and the requirements posed by the fellow travelers, we strive to provide a real world context in a more conceptual and practical manner. We, therefore, create enriching programs tailored to specific curriculum and our journeys are designed to support more than one disciplinary connection such as history and culture, heritage and arts to name a few. We believe that traveling with GBI can do a lot more than a change in the way a person perceives the world; it can enhance their skills and their ability to make the world a better place."/>

      <paragraph text="We, as an organisation also cater MICE, events, corporate meetups and conferences with best-in-class service and quality that speaks for itself. With our 24x7 personal and professional support, assurance to our clients , we have been successful in maintaining an excellent track record in the educational and corporate world. We have been our client’s favourite in providing them with unforgettable experiences on their journeys through several team building activities, workshops & seminar facilities."/>

      <paragraph text="Our team of experienced and well trained excursion event managers are capable enough to handle any situation with ease, when you are on the tour with us. Our Management believes in one simple concept that is to be truthful to ourselves and give value to our GBI clients."/>
      <paragraph text="We as an organization believe in one simple thing “Move Ahead With Time” and so we are  changing our research patterns and approaches with time to meet the demands and requirements of the new upcoming trends."/>

      <paragraph text="As an educational travel specialist we believe that  learning never stops, neither the advancements pertaining to history/culture, architecture, religion and science . It is us who needs to identify the scenarios that best fits us in a particular situation while we are on the go." />
      <br />
      <sub-heading text="Success does not lie in results but in efforts" />
      <paragraph text="At GBI, we believe that to travel is to learn. It’s a belief that has shaped our path for the last 35 years and something that drive us to keep “moving ahead with time”. We foster a worldwide perspective and are attuned socially and culturally to the ever changing landscape of the classroom and the competitive global market. Keeping this in mind, we offer a number of tour programs covering a wide array of topics. Since its inception, GBI has sent more than one lakh students to different destinations across the globe." />
